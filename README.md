# 3rd-Person-Arrow-Shooter
A 3rd Person Shooter, a test project simulating the use of bows and arrows in a fast-paced pvp environment made with Unity

A small coding adventure built in Unity3D.

Since its a Unity project you can run by just downloading the executable.

The project was a proof of concept for a third person shooter game with the use of bows and 
an emphasis on fast movement and different arrow types. The scene demonstrates the core gameplay
with the player in a firing range of sorts and a sandbox setting to experiment with the different 
ammo types on test dummies which will ragdoll once struck by an arrow.

Used W,A,S,D to move, space to jump, shift to sprint and scroll the mousewheel to change ammo types.
